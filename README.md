RPG-Game-for-Gosu
=================

Simple RPG prototype engine in Gosu, based on Dahrkael/RPG-Template-for-Ruby-Gosu


Details
=======

Part of code is used from [Dahrkael/RPG-Template-for-Ruby-Gosu](https://github.com/Dahrkael/RPG-Template-for-Ruby-Gosu/ "Dahrkael/RPG-Template-for-Ruby-Gosu"), which was a big inspiration. Unfortunately, that project was abandoned by owner :(
I changed few things, others wrote by my own and by my own idea. Engine isn't ready and shows only basic features, options. Why? Because I wrote it for lecture project on my university and it was good enough to pass class :)

Feel free to do whatever you want with this :)
